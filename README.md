# AI/agentic automated recipe maker, made with CrewAI

This is an experimental AI/agentic automated recipe maker, made with CrewAI.

The work is done by 4 agents:

- chef: the one that crafts the initial recipe, focusing in a beautiful and visually appealing dish
- food_critic: the one that critics the recipe, assessing if it is too complex or less tasteful
- nutritionist: the one that compiles the nutrition facts about the recipe, assessing if it is too fatty or caloric
- writer: the one that writes the final recipe, in the desired language

Note:
- the recipes created consider only ingredients found in the given location
- the recipes are created in the given language
